# Port Scanner Using Python – Project Report

## Objective
To develop a Python-based port scanner capable of identifying open TCP ports
on a target system.

## Introduction
Open network ports indicate active services that may present security risks
if misconfigured. Port scanning is a fundamental reconnaissance technique
in cybersecurity.

## Methodology
- Establish TCP socket connections to common ports
- Identify open ports based on successful connections
- Display results in real time

## Advantages
- Simple and effective
- Lightweight implementation
- Easy to extend with threading

## Limitations
- Scans limited port set
- Sequential scanning

## Future Enhancements
- Multithreaded scanning
- Custom port range input
- Service banner detection

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how port scanning helps identify exposed services
and assess system attack surfaces.
